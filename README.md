### Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Su
#### Full Stack Developer
Since middle school, I have been captivated by the world of programming. During high school, I immersed myself in the fundamental tools of a full-stack developer, such as ASP.NET, React, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Reactstrap. But my curiosity didn't stop there.

Artificial Intelligence intrigued me with its ability to mimic human learning and decision-making. I delved into the intricacies of AI by exploring Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. For more information, click here. I find solace in the logic and creativity that software engineering offers.

My journey continues. Like a sponge, I absorb knowledge by taking various software engineering courses. Lines of code and algorithms propel me forward. As I hone my skills, I strive to create solutions that resonate with users, inspire innovation, and push the boundaries of technology.

Here I am, fueled by passion and determination, striving to master the art of coding with elegance and purpose.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / C# / SQL

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning React.
