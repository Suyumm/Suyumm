### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Su
#### Full-Stack Developer
Since middle school, Iâ€™ve been captivated by the world of software. In high school, I pursued a computer science track, immersing myself in ASP.NET, React, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Reactstrap the essential tools of a full-stack developer. But my curiosity didnâ€™t stop there.

Artificial intelligence beckoned an enigmatic realm where algorithms mimic human cognition. Iâ€™ve delved into the intricacies of AI, exploring neural networks, natural language processing, and machine learning. Whether itâ€™s crafting elegant code or unraveling the mysteries of AI, I find solace in the logic and creativity that software engineering offers.

My journey continues. I attend software engineering courses, absorbing knowledge like a sponge. Each line of code, each algorithm, propels me forward. And as I hone my skills, I dream of creating solutions that transcend mere functionality solutions that resonate with users, inspire change, and perhaps even touch the edges of innovation.

So here I am, fueled by passion and determination, striving to master the art of code one elegant function at a time.
